# ECPI CIS453L Interface Design II Lab project projectWeek3Lab3.2

Company: PigmentWay
This project is related to an online e-commerce platform for pigments. Pigments are color products that users can browse, view details for, and add to their cart. The project includes functionality to manage a shopping cart, with features such as adding and removing items, viewing the cart, and calculating the total price of items in the cart.

The components included are: Home, About, Contact, CustomImage and Products
The Products component includes the most important parts of the project. Here are some of them: 
ProductsPage: This is the page where users can view a list of pigment products. Each product is displayed using the ProductCard component. Users can add products to their cart and view the cart.
ProductCard: This component represents a single pigment product. It displays the product details including name, description, price, and an option to add the product to the cart. If the product is already in the cart, the component shows the quantity and an option to remove it from the cart.

CartPage: This component displays the user's cart with the added products. It shows the list of products in the cart, their quantities, and total prices. Users can remove items from the cart and refresh the cart.
It also includes styled-components and CSS.

The project's focus is on building the front-end user interface for this e-commerce platform, allowing users to interact with products and manage their shopping cart. The project could potentially be extended to include features like user authentication, checkout process, and integration with a backend to manage product data and cart information.
